# dark-future

A collection of mainly dark VSCode themes that are inspired by the Dark Future of Cyberpunk fiction.

## About

This package is a collection of original color themes along with modifications of great existing themes contributed by others.
Special attention is given to these themes' ability to highlight Julia and Python code since I personally work in these languages extensively.

## Themes

- **Dark Future**: the default dark theme for the package.
- **Dark Future Cyberpunk**: a modification of the great [Cyberpunk2077](https://github.com/jwsandeman/cyberpunk2077-theme) theme.
